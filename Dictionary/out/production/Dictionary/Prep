I want to write a program that will give me opportunities:
    1) Save new words in a file
    2) Repetition of words
    3) Show words of the session

What should I have:
    1) The main class Dictionary - it will hold lines
    2) The class Line - it will hold the words

The idea of having Dictionary is
    1) Save a whole dictionary, consists of lines, in a file
        1.1) The dictionary will be being processed in order to create a game with a repetition of words
    2) The Dictionary will consist of words from an additional file
    3) It is easier in further work with a method for repetition of words. I can leverage a size of an ArrayList and use rand for lines

What should I have inside a Dictionary
    1) A method that starts a program
    2) A method that prints a whole dictionary
    3) A method that saves words in a dictionary
        3.1) The method will have a local var. an ArrayList<String> - it will hold words
    4) An instance variable ArrayList<Line> - it will hold lines
    5) A method that helps repeat words
        What should I have:
            5.1) A random number
            5.2) User limit
            5.2) An ArrayList for comparison of words
            5.3) An ArrayList for wrong words
