I intend to write code for programming coffee machines using several advantages of Java (Interfaces, Abstract classes)

CLASS CoffeeMachine will be a blueprint for different types of coffee machines.
I must declare several main behaviours:
    DECLARE method makeCoffee()
    DECLARE method makeTea()

I am going to create abstract class Coffee in order to make more specific classes based on different types of coffee.
The same situation with abstract class Tea.

ABSTRACT class Coffee
    DECLARE private var. int sizeOfCap
    DECLARE private var. int sugarAmount
    DECLARE default method setSize(int userInput)
    DECLARE default setSugarAmount(int userInput)
    DECLARE default getSugarAmount()
    DECLARE default getSize()

ABSTRACT class Tea
    DECLARE private var. int sizeOfCap
    DECLARE private var. int sugarAmount
    DECLARE default method setSize(int userInput)
    DECLARE default setSugarAmount(int userInput)
    DECLARE default getSugarAmount()
    DECLARE default getSize()

I think it is better to add a new class, where all the interactions with user will be realized.
The class WorkCoffeeMachine
